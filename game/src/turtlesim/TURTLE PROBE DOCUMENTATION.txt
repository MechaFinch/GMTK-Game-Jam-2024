Hello User! 

[unrecoverable]

Collect as much data as you can here. 

When the ship is fully refuelled, it will automatically take off and return home with whatever data you've collected.


FOURTH Basics 
=============

[ Mostly unrecoverable, but I recommend the ancient 20th-century tome 'Starting FORTH' (https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/). Here's some fragments: ]

FORTH is a stack-based language composed of Words (representing values or operations) evaluated left to right.

For example, instead of '1 + 2', you'd write '1 2 +'.

Defining a variable: 
VARIABLE VAR

Setting VAR to 0: 
0 VAR ! 

Incrementing VAR by 1: 
1 VAR +!

Adding 0 through 9 to the stack:
10 0 DO I LOOP

Adding TRUE to the stack if VAR is less than 3: 
3 VAR > IF TRUE ELSE FALSE THEN

Duplicating what's on the stack: 
DUP

Defining a new Word that increments what's on the stack by 3:
: MYWORD 3 +! ;

Useful Constants 
----------------

Relative to the world: 
- NORTH 
- SOUTH 
- EAST 
- WEST 

Relative to the direction the Turtle is facing: 
- FORWARD 
- BACK 
- LEFT 
- RIGHT

These Direction constants come in the form X Y where X and Y are integers and NORTH is 0 1. Directions are also available as enums in the format ENUM-NORTH ect where ENUM-NORTH is 0.


Moving your Turtle 
------------------

- MOVE-FORWARD
- TURN-RIGHT
- TURN-LEFT

Your Turtle will move in the direction it's currently facing. 

- UPDATE 

Your code defines this Word. Turtles run this Word in a loop when you deploy your code. 


Exploring the World 
-------------------

- EXAMINE-AHEAD 

Returns an interpretation of what is in front of the Turtle as a Word, based on the direction it's facing.

In addition to these commands, as your Turtles explore the surface, they'll come up with new Words for things they discover, just like how they come with words for METAL and FUEL. These will be added to your Dictionary as new forms are encountered with EXAMINE-AHEAD.


Interpreting the Environment 
----------------------------

Material identified as useful resources: 
- METAL 
- FUEL 

Material identified as crucial to the research mission: 
- ARTIFACT

Additional words for navigation: 
- CLEAR 
- IMPASSABLE 
- ACID 

All of these words might be returned by EXAMINE-AHEAD and can be compared. We really just keep an integer table of these.


Collection of Resources 
-----------------------

- PICK-UP 

A Turtle can pick up METAL and FUEL it encounters if instructed. Since your research ship is likely also equipped with an [unrecoverable], you'll be able to utilize these anywhere.
If this is an ARTIFACT, it will automatically be fully scanned and the information \[unrecoverable]. This is the goal of this research mission.

- GET-FUEL-AMT 
- GET-METAL-AMT

These refer to the total amount of METAL and FUEL collected.


Self-Replication 
---------------- 

- CLONE-SELF
A Turtle can construct a copy of itself provided you have enough METAL and FUEL.

- MAX-TURTLES 
The maximum number of Turtles your ship can handle.
